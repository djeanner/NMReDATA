This is a very preliminary work.... will be updated during the second par of October 2017
The file replaces an existing Mnova .qs file. (keep a copy before you overwrite). Then copy it to :
/Applications/MestReNova.app/Contents/Resources/scripts
To call it from Mnova 11:
1) load a file with some assignement
2) use the menu "Scripts/Reports/Assignments..."
It will create files in your home directory (as version 20.10.2018)
