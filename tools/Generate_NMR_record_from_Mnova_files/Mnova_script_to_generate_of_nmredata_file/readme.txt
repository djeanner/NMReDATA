This is a first stable test version of the Mnova script exporting nmredata.sdf file from Mnova files
The .qs script replaces the existing Mnova .qs file. (keep a copy before you overwrite). On mac, the scripts are in:
/Applications/MestReNova.app/Contents/Resources/scripts
To call the script from Mnova 11:
1) open a document with some assignement
2) use the menu "Scripts/Reports/Assignments..."
It will create the nmredata.sdf files in your home directory and close the document (as version Nov. 2nd 2017)
This program was used to generate the NMR records in the example folder.
