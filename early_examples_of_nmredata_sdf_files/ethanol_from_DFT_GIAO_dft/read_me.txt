This .sdf files contains NMReDATA based on DFT (for structure) and GIAO (for chemical shifts and couplings)
The NMReDATA can be viewed opening the file with any text editor. The structure can be viewer using chemdraw, pymol, etc.
These files are simple to quickly have an overview of the file contents
